    <h1>2020 IS ALMOST OVER!</h1>
    <h2>By Tyrese Oneil</h2>
    <p>My story is about what the year 2020 itself, and how this year has been one the most dreaful years in a long time for many people considering all of the horrible events that have taken place this year. And i wanted to make a story that was basically a welcoming party to the new year 2021 one as it slowly approaches in the next few weeks, hoping that that year gives us a much better outcome than this year has gave us with things such as covid, police burtality, and Donald Trump.</p>
